It's been a while since I last posted so here's some minor updates on what I've been up to:

<div class="mSpotlight">Site Updates</div>

I updated the site slightly to improve readability. I've been reading that [50-75 characters per line](http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability)
 is optimal for readability and I calculated ~92 characters per line with my current site at 1200px. So, I bumped up the
 font size and decreased the width to get roughly 80 characters per line, which goes along with
 [standard code line](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width) lengths anyway.
Next, I added anti-aliasing to my typography, following in the footsteps of the excellent typography on
[Medium](https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06), which I think is an improvement,
although there's been [posts advising against it](http://usabilitypost.com/2012/11/05/stop-fixing-font-smoothing/).

Lastly, I borrowed some fonts (notice the new post title fonts) from [CocoaInTheShell](http://cocoaintheshell.com/),
which is an excellent dark-themed blog on Cocoa development and has a cool hacker / coder  vibe that I like.

Please check out my [previous post](/tech/2014/07/20/design-104/) to see older versions.

<div class="mSpotlight">Life Updates</div>

I've been trying to enjoy the summer and recently went to Chicago to attend Wizard World's Comic Con while also
exploring Chicago for the first time. I didn't take too many good photos but I'll try to add some later. My hope is
that developing a site like [Timely](http://www.timely.es) will help me find more events like this for the future.

For whatever reason, I've been really liking Attack on Titan recently, watching it multiple times (mostly in the
background as I do other stuff); despite being quite dark and disturbing at times, it equally has some amazing scenes
and interesting characters. I think I primarily like it because of its characters, visuals, and its setting in a medieval world
 where humans are not at the top of the food chain. I also really like its soundtrack:

In other news, I got a new chair for my home office that I think is great :). More on that later...

<div class="mSpotlight">Project Updates</div>

Timely mostly became a flop after my last post because I got busy with work and all of the above. I still believe in
the idea and will see if I can work on it some more.

I've started teaching myself JavaFX for another project I've started work on but now I've switched over to Cocoa development
to build a native OSX app. I'll write a post on that later. Yep, another project to add to my graveyard of unfinished
side projects. Oh well...
