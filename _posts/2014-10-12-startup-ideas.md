In the [first startup school project](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/lists/projects/), we're supposed to
"keep a log of all the things that seem to be missing and all the problems [we] encounter in life."
Part of our assigned reading is Paul Graham's essay on ["how to get startup ideas"](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).
The essay is somewhat long so here's some cliff notes:

1. Get into the habit of noticing something missing or problematic, which can be a potential startup idea
1. The best startup ideas are something you want, something you can build, and that few others realize are worth doing
1. Work on a problem you have
1. When a startup launches, there should be some users who want it urgently
1. Entrepreneurship is learned best by doing it
1. Worrying that you're late to an idea is a sign that it's a good idea
1. Turn off the unsexy and schlep filters: be willing to work on tedious problems that you despise or fear


So here's an ongoing list of problems I've encountered or things that seem to be missing; please note that this
is a lot of brainstorming so I'm just throwing all these problems/ideas out there and for some I haven't really
researched any existing solutions.

1. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to discover and/or be notified of events or deadlines that interest me.
For example, I may want to know that there's a meetup, hackathon, or conference near me. Or I may want to know that Y Combinator has an
upcoming deadline. I don't want to go to 10 sites to keep track of all these events.
1. There isn't a great solution for finding individual food items. Today I wanted to eat a fish taco and the best
solution I found was Yelp, which yelped but was based on textual search of reviews. Another solution was [www.foodfinder.net](http://www.foodfinder.net)
but the results it gave back weren't helpful.
1. It would be great to have more friends. I mean sure I have some good friends but more friends is better, right?
1. I wish there was a way to easily monitor my site's performance and appearance across all devices. Web development
is tough.
1. I wish there was a way to predict stock market movement to better improve investment returns.
