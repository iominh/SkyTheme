Several years ago I had an opportunity to attend business school.
I prepared for months, wrote essays for applications, took the GMAT, and 
asked for recommendations. Eventually I received a letter that I was accepted. 
However, it soon occurred to me that I didn't carefully consider
the two great costs of attending: time and money.

Business school is expensive. Since I was going to enroll part-time, there
wasn't really any financial aid and I was looking at loans of $80k+. More 
importantly, though, I would be spending at least 20
hours a week for lectures and outside work. With full-time work, I 
would have very little time for anything else. 

Thus, I decided against business school. I had already experienced
graduate school once and discovered that I learn the best whenever
I'm interested and passionate about a subject. It makes sense: think about
reading some abstract math textbook versus your favorite magazine or website.
I also enjoyed grad school more than undergrad; I believe it was
because most of my classes were electives that interested me.

My plan is to create my own MBA. Over the next few years, I hope to teach myself
everything I need to know and develop my network similarly to how MBAs network
during their studies. Check back in a few years and we'll see how this turns out...
