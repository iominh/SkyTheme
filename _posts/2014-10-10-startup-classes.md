Recently I've been listening to the lectures from [Sam Altman's (Y Combinator) startup classes](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/).

- Ben Silbermann, the founder of Pinterest, recruited the initial Pinterest users by chatting up strangers in coffee

- Adora Chueng, the founder of Homejoy, pivoted 13 times from a service for providing life coaches to its current
iteration of providing house cleaning. Her rule of thumb for the art of pivoting is to track growth: if your product
isn't growing over 3-4 weeks of full product execution and hardwork then there may be a fundamental problem that may
require a pivot.

- In this lecture, Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and Palantir, talks about business strategy and the monopoly theory.
My biggest takeaway is that it's preferable to be the monopoly of a small market rather than taking on a large
market. He describes how Facebook became a monopoly of university social networks before expanding to the world, or
