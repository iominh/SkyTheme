This weekend I attended the DC Tech <a href="http://www.istrategylabs.com/" target="_blank">iStrategyLabs</a> / <a href="https://dnbdctech.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">D&amp;B Hackathon</a> and won an 
honorable mention prize for $1,000 out of ~13 teams. Woohoo! I'll admit
that the prizes are nice but I actually attend hackathons (this was my second)
because they're fun. You learn valuable skills, work in great coworking
spaces (Microsoft's office in Bethesda), meet cool people, and see awesome
projects.

<div class="mSpotlight">Prehack</div>

Typically the best teams organize prior to a hack and brainstorm ideas. They also
review the APIs and rules. I didn't actually do any of this: I went
solo and mostly spent the night before reading a little bit. However, I write code all
the time, so in actuality, I'm always preparing for hackathons.

<div class="mSpotlight">Hack</div>

Overall the hack was pretty fun. I partnered with another developer and
we formed a team on the spot. Initially we had no idea what to do and spent
a bit of time actually reading the rules, APIs, and coming up with ideas. Finally,
we decided to create <a href="http://fraudwatch.minh.io" target="_blank">http://fraudwatch.minh.io</a>:

<div class="mSpotlight">Results</div>

Finally, after many hours and very little sleep, I presented and demoed our app
to a crowd of ~100 people and 12 judges? I think we got extra points because of
our presentation, which used reveal.js slides as well as our placeit.net images showing
our mobile capabilities. We may also have gotten points because we were probably the smallest
team (team sizes typically were 3-7). Anyhow, the slides are available at <a href="http://fraudwatch.minh.io/slides" target="_blank">http://fraudwatch.minh.io/slides</a>.

I was surprised we won anything because there were some 
<a href="http://dctechhack.challengepost.com/submissions" target="_blank">amazing apps</a>. 
My favorite was one that isn't listed -- it was a beautiful map built on top of
Google Maps with the best heatmaps I've seen. I'm quite surprised they didn't 
even win honorable mention (unless I misheard?) but it might have been because
it might not have addressed the goals of the judges. Other than that I also
really liked the <a href="http://ec2-54-237-120-185.compute-1.amazonaws.com/" target="_blank">B.Verify</a>
app, which had a clean interface, great presentation, and user story.

<div class="mSpotlight">Lessons Learned</div>

I'll definitely be attending future hackathons and hope to win 1st place
someday but here are the lessons I learned:

* Expect technical issues. Before I demoed the wifi went out and 
the screen resolution was lower than we planned.
* Prepare ahead of time: we spent 33% of Saturday just reading the APIs
and brainstorming ideas.
* Team up beforehand. I've had great luck meeting good teams but I think
to get #1 it's probably best if you have a team ahead of time.
* Don't forget cables. 
* Choose teammates carefully. I actually heard from other teams where people
didn't contribute or abandoned their project.
