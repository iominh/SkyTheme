Recently I tried installing Maven on Ubuntu 13.04 but had a little difficulty.
Ideally it should've been as easy as:
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code class="bash">sudo apt-get install maven</code>
</pre>

But alas, I received the following error:

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code class="bash">Unpacking libwagon2-java (from .../libwagon2-java_2.2-3+nmu1_all.deb) ...
dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libwagon2-java_2.2-3+nmu1_all.deb (--unpack):
 trying to overwrite '/usr/share/java/wagon-tck-http.jar', which is also in package libwagon-java 1.0.0-2ubuntu2

...

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 maven : Depends: libwagon2-java (>= 2.2-2) but it is not going to be installed
</code>
</pre>

Fortunately, I googled the error and found that I <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wagon2/+bug/1171056" target="_blank">could force install libwagon</a>:

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code class="bash">sudo dpkg -i --force-all /var/cache/apt/archives/libwagon2-java_2.2-3+nmu1_all.deb
</code>
</pre>

And Maven now works! Go me. So, what was the point of this somewhat pointless post? I just needed
an excuse to try out highlight.js to syntax highlight with Jekyll 
through <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/download/" target="_blank">Yandex</a>. 
And here you go:

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code class="java">System.out.println("hello world from java!");</code>
</pre>
