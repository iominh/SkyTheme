Testing across many different platforms and browsers has always been tough.
With so many different browsers and devices, it actually becomes impossible 
without some form of automation. Luckily, in the Java world there's
free tools like Jenkins and Selenium which allow for automated GUI testing.

Recently I looked into a free continuous integration host called Travis CI that
allows me to run tests immediately after I commit my code to Github, which is 
brilliant. I was able to get it up and running after 10-15 minutes by following
their getting-started guide: <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/" target="_blank">http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/</a>

You can check out my current repo here: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/minhongrails/DataStructures" target="_blank">https://travis-ci.org/minhongrails/DataStructures</a> and my git project page <a href="https://github.com/minhongrails/DataStructuresAlgorithms" target="_blank">here</a>: 

I'll update this post again once I've tried them out for a while.
