In this post I wanted to share my experience with the [Java 7 1Z0-803 certification](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=458&get_params=p_track_id:JSE7Prog). There are probably naysayers who will say that certifications are worthless but I've actually found that combining formal education
with practical experience leads to the best results. It also doesn't hurt to have an extra credential to show that 
you aren't some newb.

So far, my plan is to do the practice exams since I 
should know the material given the number of years I've been using Java (more than 6?).
Then once I complete the exams I'll focus on my weak areas and repeat the process.
Luckily as an Amazon Prime user and Kindle owner I was able to borrow from the Kindle 
library for "free." I found great reviews of 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Certified-Associate-Programmer-Practice-ebook/dp/B007SA1GNU" target="_blank">OCAJP Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 7 Programmer Practice Exams [Kindle Edition]</a> so I borrowed that and
started my first exam.

My first exam sucked. I spent ~4 hours answering 90 questions
and scored 47/90 or 52%. On the real test, I would need to complete the exam in
2 hours 20 minutes and score at least 77%. To my credit, though, I checked my
answers as I went along and I kind of rushed through several questions.
Nonetheless, it showed that I still have some work to do and can't just breeze
through this test with just a day of studying.

I still have 5 more exams to go so I'll update this post as I complete more exams and do the actual test. In a future
post I may also cover some Java quirks that caught me off guard.
