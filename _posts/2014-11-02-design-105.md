Today I was feeling motivated so I updated my site's design. For quite some time I've felt that my site
has been boring since it's been too focused on typography and readability, perhaps to an extreme. The reasoning
behind this was that most of my traffic comes from Google searches so I wanted my content to be quickly loaded and
 easily readable without unnecessary bloat.

At the same time though, I understand most users don't want to read and want eye candy (images and colors). Well,
I'm hoping this new design is a move in that direction. It's still a work in progress since I want to make sure
performance is still optimal and doesn't hurt my search rankings (speed and responsive design actually are
factors in search rankings).

<p class="spotlight">Inspirations</p>

1. [Pylon.io's Tumblr blog](http://blog.pylon.io/). I liked the header image and sci-fi look.
1. [Treehouse Show](https://teamtreehouse.com/). I love their podcast and site. In particular, I replaced my
page's top black border with many colors. I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) to create a color theme from some really cool [Faster Than Light (FTL) posters](http://pixalry.io/search/faster+than+light) I saw on [Pixalry](http://pixalry.io/).
1. I decided to create a theme to my sci-fi theme to my site because I love sci-fi and all things futuristic / technology
related. While working on these updates I listened to the soundtrack from [Faster than light](http://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/ftl),
which is really great.
1. [Yearofmoo](http://www.yearofmoo.com/) is an AngularJs blog that I've been enjoying and learning from. It's shown
me that technical blogs don't have to be boring and can actually look nice.


<p class="spotlight">So, what's next?</p>

1. I'm using an [Adrift wallpaper](http://digital-art-gallery.com/artist/4074) by Michel Koch so I need to make
sure he's okay with it or else I'll replace it and find something else
1. I need to start adding header images to various posts as appropriate
1. I need to measure performance, page rankings, and do lots of responsive image optimizations (probably will use Gulp or
Grunt with ImageMagick)
1. I need to update my portfolio page. In particular, I've been wanting to make either dedicated project pages
or some type of coverflow (maybe similar to the shadowbox implementations seen on Pixalry). I might switch my current
shadowbox back to magnific depending on how much I can customize it
1. I need to update my about page to be much cooler, maybe using D3 or CSS3 animations.
1. I need to write more tutorials and useful content. Really, I think if I can make a couple of useful open source
projects that'll help my traffic.
