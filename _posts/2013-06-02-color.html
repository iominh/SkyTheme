Recently I came across <a href="http://www.ianli.com/isee/make.php" target="_blank">Ian Li's "I See"</a>
project which visualizes text through different colors. It looked awesome and I
found myself fascinated trying to associate colors with text. Naturally, I had to 
create my own version of it, so here's my <a href="http://color.minh.io">attempt</a>:
<br>
<br>

<br>

It actually took quite a bit of effort to build this but overall it
turned out decently. I got a chance to play with Raphael JS and perform
hue transforms on RGB colors (yay matrix math). There's still some things I want
to do so that I'm not totally just copying Ian's project so I'll update
this again later.

Anyway, I did a little research and apparently there's a lot of <a href="http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/color-meaning.html" target="_blank">meaning</a> behind colors.

<p>Here's a table of the common colors</p>
<table class="table table-bordered colorTable">

Another area I'm very interested in exploring is image processing and in particular
the ability to create filters to add different color tones to images.

<style>

    .colorTable td {
        text-align:center;
    }
</style>
