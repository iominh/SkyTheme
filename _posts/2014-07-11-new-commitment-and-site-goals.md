I've been doing a poor job of updating this site recently and this post is my commitment to make an improvement.

As it turns out, I've been slacking on my side projects because I've been very focused on my projects at
[Ringtail Design](www.ringtaildesign.com) (we're hiring by the way) where I do all sorts of interesting (mostly webapp) development
while learning UX and new skills.

<div class="mSpotlight">Metrics</div>

So, what's my baseline and where can I improve from here? For starters, I rarely post more than once a month, which should be fairly
easy to beat. For a good stretch last year I posted lots of posts about technical problems and solutions I encountered. This was mostly to
get a "longest streak" open source contributions achievement on GitHub but they're since changed it so it only tracks recent contributions.

Here's my google analytics summary, which shows roughly 730 page views from June 10, 2014 to July 10, 2014 (I use the [Chrome
Google Analytics Opt-out add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) so my views aren't included):

<p/>

Apparently most of my traffic (424 sessions out of 517) comes from organic google searches and luckily I have some top 5 hits:

<a class="lightbox" href="/assets/img/metrics/seo_june10_july10_2014.png"><img class='imageSpotlight' src="/assets/img/metrics/seo_june10_july10_2014.png" alt="left.JPG" width="900px"/></a>


<div class="mSpotlight">Strategy</div>

I'm not entirely sure how many of those 730 page views and 443 reported users are actually people and not bots but
from analyzing their incoming landing pages for users that actually spend time on more than one page, I've identified
that my most visited posts appear to be:

<a class="lightbox" href="/assets/img/metrics/top_june10_july10_2014.png"><img class='imageSpotlight' src="/assets/img/metrics/top_june10_july10_2014.png" alt="left.JPG" width="900px"/></a>

So, clearly, if I want to improve traffic I need to write more useful tutorials. Overall, I'm still very impressed
that I'm actually getting any traffic at all considering how little I write and how low quality my posts generally are (
I've been focusing on quantity over quality). In the past I actually wrote more quality content related to biotech
and I had to do lots of marketing for much less traffic whereas with this blog I do zero marketing.
