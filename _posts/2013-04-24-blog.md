This post will describe how I created this website and blog. In a nutshell, the
key ingredients were: 
<ul>
    <li>Linode with Ubuntu (VPS web hosting) - $20/month + $5/month for backups</li>
    <li>Nginx - fast static content web server</li>
    <li>Jekyll - blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby</li>
    <li>Bootstrap - UI framework w/ responsive design</li>
    <li>Jekyll Bootstrap - starter kit for jekyll and bootstrap</li>
    <li>Disqus - global comment/community management</li>
    <li>Git - source control system</li>
</ul>

This entire site is open sourced <a href="https://github.com/minhongrails/blog" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Previously I've created websites and blogs using Wordpress, Drupal, and shared hosting
and for anyone starting out with zero budget, I would recommend they look into

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.byethost.com">http://www.byethost.com</a>  - PHP, free hosting, no ads</li>
<li><a href="http://www.000webhost.com">http://www.000webhost.com</a> - PHP, free hosting, no ads, 
    kept getting 502 bad gateway errors on my phone, so I switched to byethost</li>
</ul>


There are of course lots of easier options like Wordpress, Tumblr, etc, but
generally if you want more control (e.g. more detailed user management) and freedom
in your technology stack (i.e. not just PHP or a WP plugin, etc) then moving 
towards a free PHP host or a VPS like Linode is probably a good idea.
