Recently I decided to change my design, so I greatly simplified everything
(removed Isotope, distracting colors) and focused on large, readable fonts.

I found inspiration from <a href="http://www.medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a>,
which has beautiful typography for optimal readability on all sorts of screens.
I also came across Zach Holman's <a href="http://zachholman.com" target="_blank">web site</a> and
so I "borrowed" some of his design elements. Lastly, the new design also
was heavily influenced by Apple.com and a Tumblr blog called <a href="http://all-thats-interesting.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">"all that's interesting."</a>

I'm still not entirely satisfied with my design so of course I'll be updating it
again in the future. In particular, I want to make it less boring and add images
or color. 

For reference, I backed up my old design <a href="http://design2.minh.io" target="_blank">here.</a>
