For anyone who may have noticed, I've made some subtle changes to the site's design once again. These changes
include

* A light gray background color that replaces the previous white background. I've changed the colors quite a bit
over time but I currently prefer the current gray color because it highlights the content. I may convert back
because part of the reason I switched to a white background was because I liked the minimalism behind
[Medium](http://www.medium.com), [Ghost](www.ghost.org), and
[Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/).
* A newer navbar with [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io/) icons to give the site more personality. In the next revision I'll try to add
more personality through animations and transitions. Recently, I've been inspired by [AprilZero's cool usage
 of animations and transitions](http://www.aprilzero.com/).
* Slightly smaller font size. It's always a tough balancing act because I want the content to be very readable
 with no zooming. At the same time, however, I don't want to make the user scroll too much.
* A slightly slider width for the desktop view (820px vs 800px) to accommodate the new icons
* Lots of other small design tweaks (transitions, hover effects, etc).

To see my design changes over time (hopefully it's been improving), here's my previous versions:

* [Version 1.0.3](http://design8.minh.io/)
* [Version 1.0.2](http://design5.minh.io/)
* [Version 1.0.1](http://design4.minh.io/)
* [Version 1.0.0](http://design2.minh.io/)

I've also made some small code organization / infrastructure changes:

* I've been iteratively refactoring my CSS into [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), which is much more maintainable
* I've started improving my tagging git code with [semantic tags](http://semver.org/)
* I've added [Bower](http://www.bower.io) to maintain my client side dependencies
