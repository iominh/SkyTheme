This post is just a collection of various articles and interesting sites I've bookmarked over some time. I'll keep
updating as I find more stuff.

<p class="spotlight">APIs to explore</p>

[Wit Speech API](https://wit.ai/blog/2014/02/12/speech-api) is essentially a Siri-like API that's free to use
for non-commercial products. Their [demo](http://labs.wit.ai/demo/) is pretty neat.


<p class="spotlight">Git Articles</p>

I've really loved using Git having come from other version control systems like SVN or ClearCase. It's not easy to
love a version control system but it's really improved my productivity and allowed me to experiment because I know
I can always restore a previous version; it's also super duper fast. Anyway, lately I've been teaching myself Git Flow and there's some nice articles on [nvie.com](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
and also on [Atlassian.com](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow).
