Lately I've been obsessing over how I can improve this site and particularly its typography. Ideally I want
the text to be perfect at all resolutions without requiring a user to zoom in or out and it has to work
across browser versions. I think I've found a solution in using REMs with PXs as fallbacks for older browsers.

There's a few articles I've been reading and most seem to revolve around the usage of REMs combined with the golden
ratio:

* [Web Typography: Using The Golden Ratio and REMâ€™s](http://gregrickaby.com/using-the-golden-ratio-and-rems/)
* [Responsive typography with REMs](https://bugsnag.com/blog/responsive-typography-with-rems)

Anyway, as I build on the next iteration of my site's design, I'll slowly convert my current usage of EM and PX (PX
primarily is inherited from my usage of Bootstrap) and hopefully everything is more readable.

I suppose if I want more traffic I should also probably work on improving my site's content. Oh well, more on that later.
