A while ago I was asked "what is good design?" and I don't think I gave a great answer. There's plenty of existing literature
on this subject but I thought I would answer it from the perspective of a software engineer.

<div class="mSpotlight">Good design is functional</div>

Users utilize software to accomplish tasks such as emailing, searching, listening to music, and so on.
If a user interface doesn't help the user because presents obstacles or is buggy then it's essentially failed.
Users can actually be very forgiving of "poorly designed" software as long as it functions well.

<br><br>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
        <td><a href="http://www.craigslist.com">CraigsList</a></td>
        <td>"Poorly designed" but very functional</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="http://www.pof.com">Plenty of Fish</a></td>
        <td>Ads galore but still the most popular dating site</td>
    </tr>
</table>

So what can we do as engineers? It's easier said than done but we can strive to create <b>functional</b>, bug-free code that
helps users; this involves continuous testing, user/customer interviews, and well written software.

<div class="mSpotlight">Good design is simple</div>

User interfaces often create extra work for users by displaying too much irrelevant information. Here are some quotes
        from people much wiser than myself:

<br><br>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
        <td>"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."</td>
        <td>Steve Jobs, quoting Leonardo da Vinci</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter"</td>
        <td>Mark Twain</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<div class="mSpotlight">Great design elicits emotion</div>

This may sound super cheesy but great design elicits emotion, preferably of the positive kind such as delight, happiness, and so on.
The non-positive emotions such as annoyance, hatred, and frustration probably don't count :).

<div class="mSpotlight">Conclusion</div>

Great design is tough and I'm not an expert by any means. Recently I came across Apple's "Intention" commercial
        with its "there are a thousand no's for every yes" philosophy, which is something I can relate to
        since I'm constantly trying new ideas and rejecting most of them.
