In this post I wanted to share a problem I've recently encountered and a new project that I've been working
on that I hope will solve that problem. Tentatively, I've called the project [Timely.es](http://timely.es).
The domain has nothing to do with Spain or Espanol, it was simply a cheaper option than an .IO domain (which is getting
somewhat expensive at $59.99 a year). Random side note: I do like Mexican food now and then. Anyway, back to the topic.

<div class="mSpotlight">The Problem and Current Solutions</div>

At the [company](http://www.ringtaildesign.com) I work at, we have a cool benefit where we can attend a technical conference
once a year. This is great but it's rather tough finding conferences since there's so many different sources like Twitter, coworkers, [meetups](http://www.meetup.com), podcasts, [EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite), [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/),
[Conferize](http://www.conferize.com/), Facebook events, or Yelp events. While some of these products are really helpful, it can be a lot of work
to stay on top of all these events across numerous sources. I've also found myself wishing there was something
that could help me find about cool events like [Comic Con](http://www.comic-con.org/cci) even [Awesome Con](http://www.awesome-con.com/).

<div class="mSpotlight">The New Solution</div>

Timely.es will essentially be a kayak / orbitz for events. It will aggregate events from numerous sources into a single
site and provide powerful filters + notifications that allow a user to easily know about upcoming events of interest.

The initial focus will be on conferences but if it gains any traction there are other interesting domains like
concerts and possibly even the financial markets (I'm sure traders/investors want to know all upcoming events for their stocks).

<div class="mSpotlight">Other Thoughts</div>

You may be asking why I'm posting about this "great idea" to the public. Well, first off, this site gets very little
traffic so it's very unlikely anyone is going to "steal" this idea let alone even read this post. But if you plan to, hey,
maybe we should team up! :).

Secondly I tend to work on problems only to discover that there's existing solutions or my initial idea wasn't that great.
This might be deja vu. However, even if this project doesn't take off, at least I will have developed new skills
along the way (hopefully!).

Finally, by writing this post, I've now forced myself to commit and finish this project. Because, as a more
experienced entrepreneur once told me, you shouldn't hide your project ideas and instead should try to share it
with everyone you meet. Ideas are only secondarily important to execution (would Facebook be Facebook if the Winklevoss twins
created Harvard Connection?).
