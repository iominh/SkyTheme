In an attempt to branch out and post about something not related to startups or coding, I thought I'll experiment
with posting some music I like listening to while at work. Usually I think sharing music isn't
great because very often I find myself loving a song one day and then the next wondering why I ever liked that song.

Anyway, I'm probably shooting myself in the foot but here's a Spotify playlist of some songs I've liked recently. You'll notice there's
actually less vocals because the point of this music is to be background music that amps you up to do some amazing stuff. I also don't normally listen to electronic music, preferring Rock instead, but for work background
music it's becoming my favorite genre.

(There should be a Spotify player above. Otherwise, something screwed up). Anyway, for anyone who wants to share their
Spotify playlists and customize the widget for their site, here's the [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/widgets/spotify-play-button/) I used to set it up.

Video game music actually works out very well while working as well it's meant to be background music. When listening to some of these
official soundtracks, doesn't it feel like you're on a grand quest to save the world?

Hopefully you like some of these songs and if anyone reads this, maybe you could offer some suggestions too :)
