It's been a little over a month since my last redesign and I've decided to
change things yet again. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I decided
to create a [blue background](http://design5.minh.io) in my previous
design but I took that out.

Recently I was inspired by several websites. I liked the navigation on
the [Play Framework's website](http://www.playframework.com/) so I imitated
that and I also liked the cleanness and readability of [Christoph Oro's portfolio](http://www.germanysbestkeptsecret.com/)
so I took lots of design elements from that. 

I also added some [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) and
a robot Favicon. There's also a search button in the menu where you can search posts
by title (still working on this).

Next up, I plan to add a search engine, rethink how to display
all of my posts since there's so many (infinite scroll maybe?), and add a tag cloud.
